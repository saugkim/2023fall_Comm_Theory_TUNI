## Classroom Exercises

One exercise session of 2 hours every week, 11 exercise sessions overall, starting from week 36 (1st period) and week 44 (2nd period) i.e. one week after the first lecture of each period. The first exercise sessions will therefore be on September 4th (in-class) and 5th (remote).
 
Each week the same exercise session is organized twice, the first is in-class at the campus and the second is remote. Both implementations occurring on the same week feature the same topic and exercises, and you can choose to attend either the remote or the in-class group (you can freely switch between the two, no need to inform the teaching staff).
 
Places and times (weeks 36-41, 44-48):
 
MONDAYS 12:15 - 14:00, in-person group, room K1703 in Konetalo building during P1 (will change to room SJ204 in Rakennustalo building during P2, with the exception of week 47 when it will be in room RI207)

TUESDAYS 12:15 - 14:00, remote group through Zoom, see link below

Person in charge: Diego Menegazzo  
Email contact: diego.menegazzo@tuni.fi   
 
 
Homework assignments and a preview of the in-class exercises will become available on this Moodle site during the course (see 'Exercise sheets and homework problems' below), about one week in advance.

In order to acquire a full bonus points from an exercise session, a student must participate to the session (either in-class or remote group) and return a more or less complete and correct solution for the weekly homework assignment of the same group.
 
Homework solutions should be sent by email to the person in charge, at the latest before the beginning of the first exercise session on the corresponding week i.e. deadline is on Monday at 12.15. Please always include some derivation or proof of the results (this is for your own benefit, because a wrong numeric result can still grant some bonus points if it is the outcome of a reasonable derivation with minor errors). Be prepared to also present and explain your solution at the blackboard or in Zoom if requested.
 
In the exercise sessions, the instructor presents model solutions to the week's problems including the homework problem. Classwork exercises solutions will be also made available on Moodle after the session.


## Matlab Exercises

The purpose of the Matlab exercises is to gain further insight into the basic theories of signals and communication systems and to learn how to simulate, process and analyze communication signals and systems using Matlab.
